Assemblies are groups of neurons whose coordinated firing is hypothesized to be the basic unit of cognition, representing objects, memories, and other relevant concepts. The first discovery that sparked interest in NEMO was that assemblies rapidly form within a brain region in response to repeated stimulation by a fixed input, and are recalled later when the same input appears again.
